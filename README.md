# Bouncing Ball
Welcome to my Git! This page has a few art/visual based programming projects that I've been working on. It also has some tools I wrote using MAYA API to help artists. Some procedural assets I did in Houdini and some games I've worked on in Unreal. Feel free to browse through them and use it as part of your school projects if you'd like.
